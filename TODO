Support -f and -i for imv. (If -f, then don't ask to overwrite and pass mv -f as well.

Merge ac_lib_readline.m4 from microdc

(dual-column) Make option to control minimum accepted number of
spaces between source and destination name.
this will affect even when autowidth is enabled (in that case

-r POSIX regular expression: single: s/(.*)\.bar$/$1\.baz/
-t translate characters like perl tr//: "tr/abc/ABC/"
-l lowercase all characters
-u uppercase all characters
-U[WORD-DELIM] uppercase first characters, lowercase rest

Substitution renaming in qmv like perl rename(1)?
