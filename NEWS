2005-08-13: renameutils 0.7.0 released
  The executables in the RPM packages now links with ncurses to prevent
  problems on Red Hat and Fedora systems.
  Handle POSIXLY_CORRECT in imv (fixes rename bug) (from Brian Hall).
  Change imv to pass command line through to mv if at least two file names
  are specified (or --target-directory option for mv) (suggested by
  Francois Marier).
  imv now checks if the source file exists prior to asking for destination
  name (suggested by Francois Marier).
  imv now detects and handles options requiring arguments for mv.
  imv now trims the edited file name. This means that the destination file
  name cannot have leading or trailing white space.
  Merge code base for imv and icp into icmd.
  Got rid of year ranges as recommended by the FSF.
  Improve the manual pages a little.
  Add Gnulib modules quote, dirname. Remove stat as it no longer exists in
  Gnulib.

  Fixed a serious memory management-related bug in imv causing renaming to
  fail for no reason.

  message.

  Manual page updates:
    Added manual page for deurlname.
    Corrected grammar.
    Removed section in imv about placing it in the Midnight Commander menu.
  Gettext is now external (no intl directory).

2004-09-17: renameutils 0.5.1 released.
  Clarified README about requirements.
  Include Makefile.am.head in lib and m4 directories in distribution
  tarball.
  Minor clean ups to the autogen.sh, Makefile.am and configure.ac files.

    Don't include (<gettext.h is enough).
    Include <locale.h> where setlocale is used.
  Check that locale was set correctly.

2004-08-26: renameutils 0.5.0 released.
  Added deurlname - a program to remove URL-escaped character sequences
  from filenames (such as %20 for space).
  Internationalized renameutils - added support for gettext.
  Removed debian support since renameutils has been in the official Debian
  archives for quite some time.
  Removed show-control-chars variable and option (automaticly assumed since
  we are using gettext).
  Fixed a bug in dual-column editformat that would cause a segfault when
  renaming files with trailing space in their names (reported by Chris
  Jantzen).
  Fixed a bug in qmv that made it impossible to rename files larger than
  2GB (reported by Chris Gentle).
  Corrected makefiles to allow for creation of staticly linked executables.
  renameutils now requires a C89-compatible compiler and C library.
  Modules from gnulib are used to improve compatibility.

  reason).
  Fixed bug in imv that made it impossible to overwrite files.
  Now compiles with more error checking (compile with -Wall).
