%description
The file renaming utilities (renameutils for short) are a set of programs                                                                       
designed to make renaming of files faster and less cumbersome.                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                                
The file renaming utilities consists of five programs - qmv, qcp, imv, icp                                                                      
and deurlname.                                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                                
The qmv ("quick move") program allows file names to be edited in a text                                                                         
editor. The names of all files in a directory are written to a text file,                                                                       
which is then edited by the user. The text file is read and parsed, and the                                                                     
changes are applied to the files.                                                                                                               
                                                                                                                                                
The qcp ("quick cp") program works like qmv, but copies files instead of                                                                        
moving them.                                                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                                
The imv ("interactive move") program, is trivial but useful when you are                                                                        
too lazy to type (or even complete) the name of the file to rename twice.                                                                       
It allows a file name to be edited in the terminal using the GNU Readline                                                                       
library. icp copies files.                                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                
The deurlname program removes URL encoded characters (such as %20                                                                               
representing space) from file names. Some programs such as w3m tend to keep                                                                     
those characters encoded in saved files.
