.TH ICP "1" "August 12, 2005" "icp (renameutils)"
.SH NAME
icp \- Copy a file by editing the destination name using GNU readline
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B icp
.RI [ OPTION ] " FILE"...
.SH DESCRIPTION
This manual page document describes the \fBicp\fP command.

\fBicp\fP is a program to interactively copy a single file.
It does this by allowing the file name to be edited inline
with GNU readline. This is very similar to using \fBcp\fP(1) and
editing the filename on the shell command-line, with one
exception - the filename does not have to be typed twice.

The \fBicp\fP program normally executes \fBcp\fP(1) to do the actual renaming.
This can however be changed with the \-\-command option.
.SH OPTIONS
These programs follow the usual GNU command line syntax, with long
options starting with two dashes (`-').

All options except those listed below are passed to \fBcp\fP.
\fBcp\fP.
.TP
\fB\-\-command\fR=\fIFILE\fR
Specify command to run instead of the default `cp'.
You do not need to specify the directory name of FILE if FILE
is found in the current path (as set by the $PATH environment
variable).

It is assumed that the command specified accepts the same set
of long and short
options that require an argument as cp. If not, you should
specify those options with \-\-arg\-options (see below).
\-\-arg-options is not needed as long as you specify option and
option value in a single word, like `--suffix=bak' instead of
`--suffix bak' when passing extra options to cp via icp.

.TP
\fB\-\-arg\-options\fR=\fIOPTION\fR[,\fIOPTION\fR...]
Specify what options for cp (or the command specified with
\-\-command) require an argument. Options may be short
(e.g. \-S) as well as long (e.g. \-\-suffix).
The default list is `S,V,no-preserve,sparse,suffix,version-control'
(correct for cp of GNU Coreutils 5.2.1).

This list is necessary because icp needs to know what arguments
specified on the command line are files to copy, or option
values (following an option).
.TP
\fB\-\-help\fR
Show summary of options.
.TP
\fB\-\-version\fR
Output version information and exit.
.SH EXAMPLES
Using icp as a Bash alias for cp:
.br
	\fBalias cp=icp\fR
