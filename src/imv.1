.TH IMV "1" "August 12, 2005" "imv (renameutils)"
.SH NAME
imv \- Rename a file by editing the destination name using GNU readline
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B imv
.RI [ OPTION ] " FILE"...
.SH DESCRIPTION
This manual page document describes the \fBimv\fP command.

\fBimv\fP is a program to interactively rename a single file.
It does this by allowing the file name to be edited inline
with GNU readline. This is very similar to using \fBmv\fP(1) and
editing the filename on the shell command-line, with one
exception - the filename does not have to be typed twice.

The \fBimv\fP program executes \fBmv\fP(1) to do the actual renaming.
.SH OPTIONS
These programs follow the usual GNU command line syntax, with long
options starting with two dashes (`-').

All options passed to \fBimv\fP except those listed below are passed to
\fBmv\fP.
